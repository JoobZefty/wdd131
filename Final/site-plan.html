			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To create a fun memory game with colors to show off the principles that I learned in this class.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience is those who like to play games online. This could be children or teenagers who are tired of the monotony of school. This could also be people who enjoy video games
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Javascript will use float elements to randomly order cards that are flipped over. Each card will have a matching color. The player will have to find its match by remembering where each color is. The player only has a certain ammount of mistakes. Javascript will be used to randomize and impliment these elements onto the html. </p>

			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#45062E]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#7F055F]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#E5A4CB]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#EBD2BE]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
