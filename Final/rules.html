            <h1>How do you play?</h1>
            <p>The game starts by clicking on a card. When a card is chosen, it will show its color. Only two cards can be actively flipped at the same time. When the two cards that are flipped share the same color, they will stay flipped. Some colors may look quite similar, yet they may be different. When these cards do not match, this will cause the player to lose health. Once the player has less than 0 health, the game will end. If the player matches all the cards on the play area correctly, then the cards will reshuffle and two will be added.</p>
            <h1>What does the score coorelate to?</h1>
            <p>The score corelates to the ammount of cards that the player has matched correctly in one round. The score will update after each round is completed.</p>
            <h1>What is Triple Mode?</h1>
            <p>In triple mode, the player will need to match three color cards per color, rather than two. This gives an intresting twist to the original game. The health per round will be ajusted to accompany this change.</p>
            <h1>Is it device compatable?</h1>
            <p>Color Memory is compatable with any web browsing software. It is compatable with both large and small screen sizes.</p>
